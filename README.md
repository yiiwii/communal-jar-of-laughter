## Communal Jar of Laughter
created by Yiwei Huang

This "Jar" enables you to laugh together with your remote friends.
It could stay in the peripheral and collect your communal laughter.
The "Jar" uses a machine learning model pre-trained with ambient noises in my daily life
during the 2020 quarantine, achieved by using [the Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

You can either laugh into the jar, or poke!
