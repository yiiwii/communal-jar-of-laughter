## Communal Jar of Laughter
created by Yiwei Huang
This is a project created during the 2021 pandemic while everyone was connecting/not connecting with each other on line.
This "Jar" enables you to laugh together with your remote friends.
It could stay in the peripheral and collect your communal laughter.
The "Jar" uses a machine learning model pre-trained with ambient noises 
and my laughter during the 2020 quarantine, achieved by using 
[the Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

You can either laugh into the jar, or poke!
Hope one day you can fill the jar with me together
